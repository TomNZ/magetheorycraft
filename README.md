This project was originally built to simulate combat in World of Warcraft for a Mage character. All of a player's abilities and stats are represented in the simulation, and an "AI" determines what actions to take at a given point in time based on optimal player behavior. WoW is a game that involves a lot of chance, so a simulation is run many times over and stats recorded about the damage incurred on each simulation. By tweaking input stats and talents, an optimal configuration can be obtained, given a certain play style.

Note that this project hasn't been updated in many years, but still serves as a good example of my coding style, so I wanted to upload it as sample work!
